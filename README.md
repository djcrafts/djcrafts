## 🚀 About Me

I'm a backend engineer focused on **high-performance systems**, **developer tooling**,  
**payments automation**, **infra pipelines**, and clean, extensible **low-level design**.

I enjoy designing reliable backend components, exploring systems internals,  
and building tools that make engineering simpler and safer.

I also actively teach and compete in algorithmic programming.
